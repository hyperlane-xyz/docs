# Troubleshooting

As you navigate the interchain space and begin sending your first messages between blockchains, you may run into some issues. This section will help you troubleshoot issues so you can get right back on the Interchain Highway and onwards to your destination!

For a simple approach to debugging messages, try the Hyperlane Explorer. It can diagnose common issues with message delivery. See [Debugging with Explorer](observability.md) for details.

Still need more help? Find our team on the [Hyperlane Discord](http://discord.gg/hyperlane) and ask away!
