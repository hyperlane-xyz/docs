# Hyperlane Introduction

Hyperlane is the first universal and permissionless interoperability framework built for the modular blockchain stack.&#x20;

Anyone can [deploy-hyperlane.md](deploy/deploy-hyperlane.md "mention") to any blockchain environment, whether it is a layer 1, rollup, or app-chain, allowing that chain to communicate seamlessly with any other chain on which Hyperlane has been deployed.

Hyperlane is designed with modularity in mind. Notably, its [sovereign-consensus](protocol/sovereign-consensus/ "mention") gives developers control over their security model, allowing them to configure, compose, and customize security according to the needs of their application.

Using Hyperlane, developers can build _Interchain Applications_ - dapps that span multiple blockchains. Some pre-built examples that can be deployed out of the box include:

1. [deploy-warp-route](deploy/deploy-warp-route/ "mention"), which allow native, `ERC20`, and `ERC721` tokens to move seamlessly across chains
2. Interchain [accounts](apis/accounts/ "mention"), which allows an account on one chain (e.g. a DAO) to make smart contract calls on remote chains
3. Interchain [query.md](apis/query.md "mention"), which allow an account on one chain to make view calls on remote chains

Keep reading to learn all the things Hyperlane can do for you!

### Integrate Hyperlane into your chain, rollup, or app

Check out the [getting-started.md](introduction/getting-started.md "mention") guide for everything you need to start building with Hyperlane. As a creator of a new Chain or Rollup, a Rollup Framework, or a Rollup Service, you can learn how to [deploy-hyperlane.md](deploy/deploy-hyperlane.md "mention") yourself!\

### Learn more about the Hyperlane protocol

First, take a look at the [faq.md](resources/faq.md "mention"), which covers some high level questions about what Hyperlane is and how it works.
