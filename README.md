# Intro to Hyperlane

Hyperlane is the modular interoperability platform. Hyperlane empowers developers to build interchain applications, apps that can communicate between many blockchain environments and offer users a unified experience.&#x20;

Hyperlane's API's offer developers secure and simple ways to communicate between blockchains, and the Hyperlane SDK can makes building interchain applications quick and easy. &#x20;
