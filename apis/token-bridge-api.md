# Liquidity Layer API

{% hint style="warning" %}
The LiquidityLayer API is in beta and deployed only on testnet. The API is subject to change
{% endhint %}

Hyperlane's Liquidity layer will wrap around several token bridges to allow developers to send tokens alongside their message.

### Send

Developers can send interchain messages very similarly to the [messaging-api](messaging-api/ "mention") by calling the `LiquidityLayerRouter.dispatchWithTokens` endpoint. At the moment, dispatched messages must be received by a contract with the `handleWithTokens()` function. You will learn more about this in the [Receive](messaging-api/receive.md) section up next, but for now let's cover the message sending interface. Remember that you need to ERC-20-approve the tokens to the `LiquidityLayerRouter`, otherwise it is not authorized to move them.

#### Interface

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT OR Apache-2.0
pragma solidity >=0.6.11;

interface ILiquidityLayerRouter {
    function dispatchWithTokens(
        uint32 _destinationDomain,
        bytes32 _recipientAddress,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        string calldata _bridge,
        bytes calldata _messageBody
    ) external returns (bytes32);
}

```

The address of the `LiquidityLayerRouter` is `0x2abe0860D81FB4242C748132bD69D125D88eaE26` on every chain.

`_destinationDomain` is the chain you're sending to, it is **not** the chainID, rather it is a unique ID assigned by the protocol to each chain. Domain ID's can be found [here](../resources/domains.md).

`_recipientAddress` is the receiving contract, it needs to be a contract with the `handleWithTokens()` function, you can read about it in the [Receive](token-bridge-api.md#receive) section.

`_messageBody` is the message you're passing.

`_token` is the address of the token on the origin chain you are trying to transfer

`_amount` is the amount of `_token` you want to transfer

`_bridge` is a string identifier for the value bridge you want to use, `"Circle"` or `"Portal"` are currently supported

### Receive

Like sending, receiving is very similar to the [messaging-api](messaging-api/ "mention"):thumbsup:

#### Interface

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

interface ILiquidityLayerMessageRecipient {
    function handleWithTokens(
        uint32 _origin,
        bytes32 _sender,
        bytes calldata _message,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount
    ) external;
}

```

`_origin` the Domain ID of the source chain, IDs found [here](../resources/domains.md#mainnet).

`_sender` the address of the message sender on the source chain

`_messageBody` the message being passed.

`_address` is the address of the token that was transferred to the recipient

`_amount` is the amount of the token that was transferred

The same points about access control and encoding from the [messaging-api](messaging-api/ "mention") apply to the LiquidityLayer API as well, so be sure to check it out. However, rather than requiring access control such that the Mailbox can only call the `handle` function, the LiquidityLayerRouter on the local chain must be the only address that can call the `handleWithTokens` function.

### Paying for Interchain Gas

Just like all Hyperlane messages that wish to have their messages delivered by a relayer, users must [pay for interchain gas](../build-with-hyperlane/guides/developers/paying-for-interchain-gas/).

The `dispatchWithTokens` function in the Liquidity Layer API returns the message ID as a `bytes32`. This message ID can then be used by the caller to pay for interchain gas.

Because the Liquidity Layer uses the default ISM for security, the [DefaultIsmInterchainGasPaymaster](../resources/addresses.md#defaultisminterchaingaspaymaster-1) IGP should be used. When specifying the amount of gas, the caller must pay for a gas amount high enough to cover:

1. "Overhead" gas used by the Liquidity Layer contract on the destination chain. This is about **280,000 gas**. This is because the actual cost of bridging the tokens via the underlying Circle or Portal bridge can be fairly high.
2. The gas used by the recipient's `handleWithTokens` function on the destination chain.

#### Gas Payment Example

```solidity
function dispatchWithTokensAndPayGas() external payable {
    // First, dispatch with tokens
    bytes32 messageId = liquidityLayer.dispatchWithTokens(/* ... */);

    // Then, pay for gas

    // The mainnet DefaultIsmInterchainGasPaymaster
    IInterchainGasPaymaster igp = IInterchainGasPaymaster(
        0x56f52c0A1ddcD557285f7CBc782D3d83096CE1Cc
    );
    // Pay with the msg.value
    igp.payForGas{ value: msg.value }(
         // The ID of the message
         messageId,
         // Destination domain
         destinationDomain,
         // The total gas amount. This should be the
         // overhead gas amount (280,000 gas) + gas used by the call being made.
         // For example, if the handleWithTokens function uses 120,000 gas,
         // we pay for 400k gas.
         400000,
         // Refund the msg.sender
         msg.sender
     );
}
```
