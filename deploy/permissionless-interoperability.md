# Overview

**Before Hyperlane**

Interchain interoperability remains permissioned across the industry. And to be fair, there are good reasons for this. It's well understood that the security of any distributed system falls to the security of its weakest link. And in a world of anonymous systems and users, the need for permissioning communications feels more comforting. But the comfort comes with side effects.

Developers wishing to work with unsupported chains now have to petition interoperability platforms to add their desired network. An untenable situation for both sides as the number of chains continuously increases. We built Hyperlane to tackle this problem.

**Introducing Permissionless Interoperability**

Permissionless Interoperability means that you have the freedom to deploy Hyperlane anywhere. Bring a complete set of interoperability features to any blockchain, any appchain, any rollup, anytime. And you don't have to ask the Hyperlane team or anyone else. No one can stop you from doing it. As a builder using Hyperlane, you are in complete control of your destiny.

The permissionless and modular design of Hyperlane powers many unique features:

* Expand to any environment without reliance on external parties with [Permissionless Deployment](deploy-hyperlane/)
* Own and customize your app's security model with your choice of [sovereign-consensus](../protocol/sovereign-consensus/ "mention") (ISMs)&#x20;
* Move value anywhere, permissionlessly with [Warp Routes](../apis-and-sdks/warp-api.md)

The Hyperlane thesis is that&#x20;

* Permissionless Interoperability will accelerate adoption of new ecosystems and snowballs interchain interoperability until it reaches parity across all ecosystems.
* Modular security siloes risk across the network so that even the weakest points carry minimal risk radius. Customizable security models and message filtering enables users to easily and thoroughly filter out weak points.

**The Permissionless End Game**

We envision an end game where the developer burden is as minimal as possible. Currently, the biggest burden that faced by permissionless deployers is [Relaying](../operators/relayers/), with security initialization and configuration to a lesser extent. The long term vision is one where a relayer network exists to cater to the needs of permissionless deployers. A deployer script would include information, terms, and payment under which relayer services for a new network will be provided. This way, new networks can be added without the deployer needing to operate a relayer service.

Reducing the burden of configuring and initializing a security module will likely be addressed by allowing developers to cast an on-chain petition to existing security module operators, and to enlist their services to secure the chain. The first modules that will support this feature will likely be economic security modules, leveraging both direct proof of stake and restaking.
