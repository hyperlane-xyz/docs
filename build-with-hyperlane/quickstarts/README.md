# Quickstarts

Each API has a Quickstart section that can be used with just Metamask or [Cast by Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/).

### Messaging&#x20;

Hyperlane makes interchain communication straightforward by providing a simple on-chain API for sending and receiving messages.

Send your first message in under 5 minutes with the [messaging.md](messaging.md "mention") quickstart.

### Interchain Accounts

With Hyperlane, you can make a simple call via Interchain Accounts to a pre-deployed [`TestRecipient`](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/test/TestRecipient.sol) contract on a remote destination chain.&#x20;

Try it here with the [accounts.md](accounts.md "mention") quickstart.

### Interchain Queries

Query any contract, not just `IMessageRecipient`s with the `handle()` function (even legacy contracts!).&#x20;

Make a view call in moments using `TestQuerySender` and the [queries.md](queries.md "mention") quickstart.

### Sending Tokens

You've sent messages with Hyperlane; now it's time to bring value into the mix.&#x20;

Send tokens alongside messages with the [quickstart-tutorial-1.md](quickstart-tutorial-1.md "mention") quickstart.
