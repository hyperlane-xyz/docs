description: Build interchain smart contracts

# Solidity SDK

The solidity SDK ([`@hyperlane-xyz/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperlane-xyz/core)) contains smart contract libraries for helping you write your interchain apps, including:

### [`HyperlaneConnectionClient`](abacusconnectionclient.md)&#x20;

A mix-in that your contract can inherit from when integrating with Hyperlane.

### [`Router`](router.md)&#x20;

A mix-in contract, which implements a recommended pattern for interchain applications. Contracts can be written once and then deployed across many chains.
