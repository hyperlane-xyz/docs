# Deployment

`HyperlaneDeployer` helps manage the deployment of contracts across multiple chains. Hyperlane apps should extend a deployer to specify the needed types and implement any needed logic for deployment of their contracts.&#x20;

### Implement

Developers must provide an implementation for `deployContracts` which describes the logic for deploying the application on a single chain. Developers building with the [Router](../writing-contracts/router.md) pattern can extend `HyperlaneRouterDeployer`, which handles some Router-specific boilerplate.

Deployers will also need contract [Factories](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract-factory/), which be defined manually or generated automatically by tooling like TypeChain (recommended).

```typescript
import { HyperlaneRouterDeployer, ChainName } from '@hyperlane-xyz/sdk';

class MyDeployer<Chain extends ChainName, MyConfig>
  extends HyperlaneRouterDeployer<Chain, MyContracts, MyFactories, MyConfig> { 
    function deployContracts(network: Networks, config: MyConfig) {
      // Custom contract deployment logic to goes here
      // This method is called once for each target chain
    }
}
```

For a simple, single contract app that extends the `Router` contract, it is sufficient to call the `deployContract` method in the `deployContracts` implementation:

```typescript
  async deployContracts(chain: Chain, config: HelloWorldConfig) {
    const router = await this.deployContract(chain, 'router', [
      config.mailbox,
      config.interchainGasPaymaster,
    ]);
    return {
      router,
    };
  }
```

{% endhint %}

### Interact

Once a`HyperlaneDeployer` class has been defined, the deployer can be instantiated with a [Multiprovider](multiprovider.md) and a map of chains to configurations. These configs will be provided to your `deployContracts` methods and can include any values needed there. The initialization of Invoking `deploy()` will deploy contracts for all specified chains.&#x20;

```typescript
const ethereum: MyConfig = {...};
const polygon: MyConfig = {...};
const myDeployer = new MyDeployer(multiProvider, { ethereum, polygon });
const contracts = await myDeployer.deploy();
```

In scripts that calls `deploy`, consider persisting deployment artifacts as they will be  important for future use of your application. This includes addresses, compiler options, and contract constructor arguments.

For an example deployment script, see the [Hyperlane Hello World](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-app-template/blob/main/src/deploy/deploy.ts) app. This script is the same as the one provided above.&#x20;
