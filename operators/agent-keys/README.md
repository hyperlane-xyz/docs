# Agent keys

Hyperlane agents must be configured with private keys in order to operate. [validators.md](../../protocol/agents/validators.md "mention") use private keys to sign attestations, and [relayer.md](../../protocol/agents/relayer.md "mention") use private keys to sign transactions that deliver messages.

Hyperlane agents currently support being configured with private keys in one of two ways.

## 1. Hexadecimal keys

A raw hexadecimal private key used for in-memory signing. This is the recommended setup for testing or development purposes, but not recommended for production. Hexadecimal keys are **especially** discouraged for production validators.

## 2. AWS KMS

A key generated by AWS and stored in a CloudHSM. This is the recommended setup for production agents, **especially** for validators.
