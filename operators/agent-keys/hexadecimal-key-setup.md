# Hexadecimal keys

Using hexadecimal keys is the easiest and fastest way to configure Hyperlane agents.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Hexadecimal keys are not recommended for production environments, for which [aws-setup.md](aws-setup.md "mention") are recommended.
{% endhint %}

### Generate a hexadecimal key&#x20;

Keep track of your address and private key for use with your agent.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Cast CLI" %}
Using [Foundry's cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/), you can create a new key pair:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sh
cast wallet new
```
{% endcode %}

The output will look something like this:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
Successfully created new keypair.
Address: 0x32e6d32E7b1C8691Ef4ad3841003371214a0eebC
Private Key: 0x2958f0eb2ab71bbfb5ea1422835e20e488778b61e3c107f369572e2b53b578f9
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Using privatekeys.pw" %}
You can visit [https://privatekeys.pw/keys/ethereum/random](https://privatekeys.pw/keys/ethereum/random), which will automatically display a list of hexadecimal private keys and their addresses.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that because these are generated by a website, these private keys should be considered insecure and should not be used for anything other than testing purposes!
