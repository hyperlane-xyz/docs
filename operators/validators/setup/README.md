# Setup

## Local setup

{% hint style="warning" %}
The local setup is only intended for testing or development purposes.

Local validators can only be accessed by a relayer that's operated on the same machine with access to the same filesystem.
{% endhint %}

If you just want to run a validator locally for test or development purposes, you can refer to the [Local setup](local-setup.md) instructions. Note this differs greatly from a production environment where validator keys should be more secure and signatures should be publicly accessible.

{% content-ref url="local-setup.md" %}
[local-setup.md](local-setup.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## AWS setup (production)

For a production environment where validator keys are held more securely and validator signatures are publicly accessible, refer to the [AWS setup](aws-setup.md) instructions.

{% content-ref url="aws-setup.md" %}
[aws-setup.md](aws-setup.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
